        h2.title Login demo page
        p This layout demonstrates a local login feature with link only (no modal), if you need to link away to a login page.
        p This is a basic copy of the About Us template, but has a login <a href="/layouts/with-login-link/source">built into the source</a>, in a class called <code>page-local-login</code>. If this is left empty, and a <code>date-href</code> attribute is added the system will convert this to a login link as above. Note that the title of the login button in the header can be manipulated by using the <code>data-title</code> attribute on this element, if for example you want to change the title to "Logout" when a user is logged in. The title will be "Login" by default, and there is a hard limit of 7 characters.
        p <a href="/layouts/with-login">This layout</a> builds in a modal dialog from local markup instead, if you are using ajax methods to manage login.

        p The Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences means improved cohesion across our courses and a strengthening of our research capabilities. The new Faculty also encourages collaboration between our enthusiastic, passionate and like-minded academics across two complimentary disciplines. Our students experience cross-disciplinary teaching by specialised veterinary, animal production, crop and food science experts addressing complex environmental, economic and social issues.
        p When you study veterinary or agricultural science at the University of Melbourne, you do so not only at Australia’s highest ranked university but also within a Faculty that ranks with the best in the world.
        p Our courses are delivered from three campuses: Parkville (our main campus on the City fringe), Werribee (the site of our world-class Veterinary Hospital) and Dookie – a state-of-the-art broad-acre farm renowned for its teaching, research and technology development. Exciting new opportunities are being explored at the Dookie Campus across its teaching and research programs, helped by a $5 million investment by the University, government, industry and the community.
        p The University continues to expand the number of places in the Bachelor or Agriculture course, to meet growing industry and student demand.
        p Building on the success of the Pre-Vet Club, we are also excited to launch our Pre-Ag Club. This Club is for students in Years 9 to 12 and provides the opportunity for students to engage with the University and understand more about agricultural science and the wide-range of careers available, thanks to the agricultural boom in Australia.
        p I encourage you to explore our website and review the range of exciting and diverse courses on offer. There has never been a better time to join the Faculty.
