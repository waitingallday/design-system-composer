          h2 Outage to University websites this Sunday
          p This Sunday (22 November) between 6am and 7am, a wide range of University websites will be offline for around 30 minutes as an important upgrade takes place on the underlying infrastructure. This includes the University homepage, Staff and Student Hubs, Library, About Us and other University websites. Themis, the LMS, Student Portal and other key applications will continue to operate as normal. This time has been selected to try to minimise disruption.
