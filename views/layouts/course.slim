Each of the six determinants of health ( genetics, environment, nutrition, welfare, infectious disease and exposure to toxic agents) is explored with reference to authentic case studies. Appreciation of the multifactorial nature of health determination is then developed as students apply their understanding to cases that require integration of multiple principles in the analysis of animal health issues. Through industry based placements as well as case based syndicate work, students apply their understanding o...

Integrating knowledge and understanding derived from every subject in their course, students evaluate issues relating to animal health, welfare and production and conduct critical analysis of data provided to them. Successful completion of this subject will be based on participation in the requisite number of approved placements and submission of written reports.

                        p This capstone subject takes a multi-disciplinary approach to the investigation of health and disease in domestic animals. Students will be introduced to the structural and functional organisational units of the body and to the fundamental principles of veterinary anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology, general pathology and immunology. Students will gain a theoretical knowledge and practical laboratory skills that are fundamental to an appraisal of the health of domestic animals.

Integrating knowledge and understanding derived from every subject in their course, students evaluate issues relating to animal health, welfare and production and conduct critical analysis of data provided to them. Successful completion of this subject will be based on participation in the requisite number of approved placements and submission of written reports.
